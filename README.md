# LinearRegression

## Overview
I'm using a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied. Intuitively, there must be a relationship right? The more you study, the better your test scores should be. We're going to use [linear regression](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/node/250) to prove this relationship. 

## Dependencies

* numpy

Python 2 and 3 both work for this. Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install any dependencies.
